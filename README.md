# gis-arm64-containers

ARM64 docker images for GIS applications.

I tried to run couple of GIS services in a Docker on a raspberry pi.
Some worked out of the box, some could not handle the different architecture.  

The Dockerfiles in this repo have been used to build on a raspberry pi5.
And I publish them to Docker hub: `docker.io/mvherweg/gis-arm64-{name_of_tool}:{version_of_tool}`.
